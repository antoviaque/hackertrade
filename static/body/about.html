<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hacker Trade is a <strong>marketplace</strong> for <strong>freelance developers</strong> and <strong>no-nonsense clients</strong>. Designed for people who want to handle their development contracting online, but still value results and quality as much as price.</p>
<p>Taking applications from both contractors and clients, we work with both parties to find the right match for your project or your skills. We help you, throughout the project, to maintain a lively and constructive collaboration until completion. </p>
<p>Hackers can focus on code, and clients get peace of mind.</p>

<h1>What's different from other freelancing sites?</h1>
<p>We like a job well done, and are fond of the human part of contracting. Finding work or contractors online doesn't need to be just about cheap outsourcing. It's also a great way for like-minded developers and clients to meet each other, and work on completing projects with care and pleasure. </p>
<p>The usual approach is to let everyone and their dog enter bidding wars, which inevitably favors cheap incompetence, drives away skilled coders, and ultimately deters serious clients. Instead, we focus on working with people who like to get things done, and well.</p>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Both <a href="apply_client.html">clients</a> and <a href="apply_hacker.html">developers</a> apply online. We operate the selection process on a rolling basis; first in, first served. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We start a discussion with the selected applicants. We get to learn more about you and your projects, and check your references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we think of a good match for you, we put you in touch. You get the final word though - we only want you to work with people you like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If everyone agrees there's a match, we ask both parties to come up with a small test task (1-2 days work), to check that all is fine in real conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all agree on a set of minimum requirements and guidelines, such as the level of communication (a quick 5-15 minutes daily chat meeting throughout the project), and deliverables (the client defines small self-contained tasks, and a specific volume of work is agreed on for each week).  At this point, the work starts!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We help you initially to get set up and establish the processes. We faced the trappings of online contracting so you don't have to, both as coders and clients, and we'll make sure you are covered.</p>

<p>Once you're setup, we get out of the way, so you can deal directly between client and developer. You get to manage the project yourselves, and avoid the high price overhead of traditional agencies. We are never very far though, in case you need advices or arbitration during the project.</p>

<h1>How much does it cost?</h1>
<p>We ask for 10% of the cost of the work. In exchange, we match you with clients or developers, help you to define the work and processes, and arbitrate disagreements. </p>
<p>We also guarantee the payments - they are transfered to us before the work starts, and released as soon as the deliverables are provided as agreed and on time. This ensures clients get what they asked, and protects developers from bad payers.</p>
